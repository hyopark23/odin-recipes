        <h2>A great snack or side dish</h2>
        <p>Kimchi pancake (or 'jun' in Korean) is a simple and easy to make dish that is one of Koreans' favorite dishes.</p>
        <p>It is great to have as a stand alone snack or as a side dish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound well-fermented napa cabbage kimchi, chopped into small pieces, plus 2 tablespoons of the brine</li>
            <li>3 scallions, chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour/li>
            <li>½ cup water/li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the kimchi, kimchi brine, scallions, sugar, flour, and water in a medium bowl and mix well with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. (If you don’t have a 12-inch skillet, use a smaller skillet to make 2 pancakes.)</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the pan and spread it with the back of a spoon or a spatula to make a large circle.</li>
            <li>Cook until the bottom is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully turn the pancake over. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons oil around the edges of the skillet, then lift the pancake with a 
            thin spatula to allow the oil to run underneath and tilt the pan to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook until the bottom of the pancake is light golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip it one more time and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Slide onto a large serving platter and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
